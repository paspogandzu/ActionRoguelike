## Setting up the Sensor
 
To capture the best motion data, you need to make sure that your sensor is properly installed and calibrated. Here are some tips:

- The optimal capturing range of the sensor is between 1.5 meters and 4 meters from your body. The sensor should be placed in front of you, higher than 1.5 meters, and leveled with the floor.[^1^]
- The sensor has a wide-angle lens that can capture up to six people at once, but for better accuracy, it is recommended to capture one person at a time.[^2^]
- The sensor has a near mode that can capture your motion as close as 50 cm to the sensor, which is useful for capturing upper body movements while sitting.[^2^]
- The sensor can adjust its motor automatically to track your movement, but you can also manually adjust it using the buttons on the plug-in panel.[^1^]
- The sensor can detect and align with the floor automatically, but you can also manually calibrate it using the buttons on the plug-in panel.[^1^]
