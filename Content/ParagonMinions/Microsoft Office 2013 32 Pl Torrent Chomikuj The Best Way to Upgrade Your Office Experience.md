## What are Logarithms and Antilogarithms?
 
A logarithm is a mathematical function that tells you how many times you need to multiply a certain number (called the base) by itself to get another number (called the argument). For example, the logarithm of 1000 to the base 10 is 3, because 10 x 10 x 10 = 1000. The notation for logarithms is log<sub>base</sub>(argument). For example, log<sub>10</sub>(1000) = 3.
 
An antilogarithm is the inverse function of a logarithm. It tells you what number you need to raise a certain base to in order to get another number (called the antilogarithm). For example, the antilogarithm of 3 to the base 10 is 1000, because 10 = 1000. The notation for antilogarithms is base. For example, 10 = 1000.
 
## Why do we need Logarithm and Antilogarithm Tables?
 
Logarithms and antilogarithms are useful for simplifying calculations involving very large or very small numbers. They can also help us solve equations involving exponential or power functions. However, finding the exact value of a logarithm or an antilogarithm can be difficult without a calculator. That's why we use logarithm and antilogarithm tables, which give us approximate values of logarithms and antilogarithms for different bases and arguments.

A logarithm table usually has two parts: a characteristic part and a mantissa part. The characteristic part tells us the integer part of the logarithm, while the mantissa part tells us the decimal part of the logarithm. For example, if we want to find the value of log<sub>10</sub>(19.67), we first identify the characteristic part and the mantissa part of 19.67. The characteristic part is 1 (the integer before the decimal point), and the mantissa part is .967 (the decimal after the point). Then we look up the table for log<sub>10</sub>(1) and log<sub>10</sub>(.967). We find that log<sub>10</sub>(1) = 0 and log<sub>10</sub>(.967) = .9856. We add these two values together to get log<sub>10</sub>(19.67) = 0 + .9856 = .9856.
 
An antilogarithm table usually has one part: an antilogarithm part. It tells us the value of the antilogarithm for different bases and arguments. For example, if we want to find the value of 10, we look up the table for 10. We find that 10 = 19.67.
