In this article, we will show you how to use AmiBroker 4.80.2 AmiQuote to download data from Yahoo Finance for stocks, indices, and other securities. We will also explain how to fix some common issues that may arise due to changes in Yahoo data format.
 
## Preparing Ticker List
 
A ticker list is a simple text file that lists the tickers you want to import. The AmiQuote ticker list file has .TLS extension. AmiQuote comes with pre-written ticker list for components of main NYSE and NASDAQ indices and a number of European indices/markets. You can use those pre-written ticker lists or you can customize them or write your own one.
 
In order to edit existing .TLS file or write a new one, you need a plain text editor such as Notepad or any other plain ASCII editor (not MS Word!). All you have to do is to write tickers you want to import line by line (single ticker in single line) and save the file. Please make sure that you are saving the file with .TLS extension. Otherwise AmiQuote will not load this file.
