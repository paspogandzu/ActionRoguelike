# How to Play Berwick Saga on PS2 with English Patch
 
Berwick Saga is a tactical RPG game for the PlayStation 2 that was released in Japan in 2005. It is the sequel to Tear Ring Saga, a game created by Shouzou Kaga, the original creator of Fire Emblem. Berwick Saga features a complex and challenging gameplay system, a rich story with multiple endings, and a large cast of characters with unique personalities and skills.
 
Unfortunately, Berwick Saga was never officially localized or released outside of Japan. However, thanks to the efforts of a fan translation team led by Aethin, an English patch for the game is now available. The patch translates all the text in the game into English, including menus, dialogue, items, skills, and more. The patch also fixes some bugs and glitches in the original game.

If you want to play Berwick Saga on your PS2 with the English patch, you will need a few things:
 
- A Japanese copy of Berwick Saga (ãã£ã¢ãªã³ã°ãµã¼ã¬ã·ãªã¼ãº ãã«ã¦ã£ãã¯ãµã¼ã¬). You can buy it online or download it from sites like CDRomance[^1^] or Archive.org[^2^]. Make sure the iso file has a CRC32 checksum of 2045f6b1.
- A PS2 console that can play imported or backup games. You can use a modchip, a swap magic disc, or a Free McBoot memory card.
- A blank DVD-R disc and a DVD burner.
- The latest version of the English patch. You can download it from Serenes Forest[^1^], where you can also find more information about the patch and the game.
- A program that can apply the patch to the iso file. You can use XDelta UI or Delta Patcher.

Once you have everything ready, follow these steps:

1. Extract the zip file containing the patch. You should see two files: Berwick\_Saga\_English\_Patch.xdelta and Readme.txt.
2. Run XDelta UI or Delta Patcher and select the original iso file as the source file and the patch file as the patch file. Then choose a name and location for the output file.
3. Click on Apply Patch and wait for the process to finish. You should see a message saying that the patch was applied successfully.
4. Burn the patched iso file to a DVD-R disc using a program like ImgBurn or Nero. Make sure to use a low writing speed (4x or lower) and verify the disc after burning.
5. Insert the disc into your PS2 console and enjoy playing Berwick Saga in English!

Note: If you want to play Berwick Saga on an emulator like PCSX2, you can skip steps 4 and 5 and just load the patched iso file from your computer.
  
Berwick Saga is set in the continent of Lazberia, where two rival kingdoms, Veria and Raze, are locked in a war for supremacy. The game follows the adventures of Reese, the young lord of the Berwick League, a small nation allied with Veria. Along with his loyal knights and friends, Reese must face various enemies and challenges, both on and off the battlefield.
 
The game has 15 chapters, each with multiple scenarios that can be played in different orders. The scenarios have different objectives, such as defeating all enemies, capturing a fort, rescuing an ally, or escaping from danger. The player can also explore towns and villages, where they can buy items, recruit new characters, or trigger side events. The game also has a calendar system that affects the weather, the availability of certain scenarios and characters, and the growth of crops and livestock.
 
The combat system of Berwick Saga is similar to Fire Emblem, but with some notable differences. The game uses a hexagonal grid instead of a square one, allowing for more movement and positioning options. The game also has a durability system for weapons and items, a weight system that affects the speed and accuracy of characters, a critical hit system that depends on the direction of the attack, and a skill system that grants special abilities to characters. The game also has a permadeath feature, meaning that any character who dies in battle is gone forever.
