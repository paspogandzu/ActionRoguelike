FMDrive 2612 VSTi is not just a simple sound-alike, it is a cycle-accurate emulation of the YM2612 chip, which means it reproduces every unique feature and limitation of the original hardware. You can use PCM samples, SSG-EG envelopes, special and CSM modes, and even the optional Model 1 distortion (ladder effect) that gives some games their distinctive sound. You can also import and export presets in .tfi format, compatible with many emulators and trackers.
