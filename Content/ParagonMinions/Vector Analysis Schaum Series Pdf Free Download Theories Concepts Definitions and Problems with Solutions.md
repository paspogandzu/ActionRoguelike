## What is Vector Analysis?
 
Vector analysis is a branch of mathematics that deals with vectors and their properties. Vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction, such as force, velocity, acceleration, displacement, etc. Vector analysis studies the operations and functions of vectors, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, dot product, cross product, gradient, divergence, curl, etc.
