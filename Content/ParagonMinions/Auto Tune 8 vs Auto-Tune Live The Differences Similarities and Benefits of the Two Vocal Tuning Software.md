## Features
 
Auto-Tune 8 and Auto-Tune Live are both powerful and versatile vocal tuning software that offer a range of features to suit different needs and preferences. They both have:
 
- Automatic Mode: This mode allows you to quickly and easily correct the pitch of your vocals in real time or offline. You can choose from a variety of scales, keys and modes to match your music genre and style. You can also adjust the retune speed, humanize and natural vibrato settings to fine-tune the effect.
- Graphical Mode: This mode gives you more control and flexibility over the pitch correction process. You can manually edit the pitch curves of your vocals using a graphical interface. You can also use tools such as Line, Curve, Note Objects and MIDI to create custom effects.
- Flex-Tune: This feature lets you preserve the natural expression and nuances of your vocals while still correcting the pitch. It only applies pitch correction when your vocals deviate from the scale notes, allowing you to sing with more freedom and creativity.
- Low Latency Mode: This feature reduces the latency of the pitch correction to near zero, making it ideal for live performance or tracking in the studio. You can hear the corrected vocals in real time without any noticeable delay.
- Formant Correction: This feature preserves the natural timbre and character of your vocals while changing the pitch. It prevents the unwanted artifacts and distortion that can occur when shifting the pitch too high or low.
- Throat Modeling: This feature allows you to modify the vocal tract shape of your vocals to create different vocal characters or effects. You can change the length, width and shape of the throat to emulate different singers or styles.

However, there are also some features that are unique to each product. Auto-Tune 8 has:

- Classic Mode: This mode recreates the original sound and behavior of Auto-Tune 5, which is considered by many as the best-sounding version of Auto-Tune. It gives you a more transparent and natural pitch correction with less artifacts.
- Audio Feedback: This feature allows you to hear the corrected pitch as a reference tone through your speakers or headphones. It can help you improve your singing accuracy and intonation.
- MIDI Control: This feature allows you to control the pitch correction parameters using a MIDI controller or keyboard. You can use MIDI notes to specify the target pitches or use MIDI CC messages to adjust the retune speed, humanize and other settings.

Auto-Tune Live has:

- Auto-Motion: This feature allows you to create complex melodic patterns from your vocals using a built-in pattern generator. You can choose from a variety of presets or create your own patterns using a simple interface. You can also sync the patterns to your host tempo or trigger them manually.
- Targeting Ignores Vibrato: This feature allows you to ignore the natural vibrato of your vocals when applying pitch correction. It can help you achieve a more consistent and smooth pitch correction without affecting the expression of your vocals.

## Performance
 
Both Auto-Tune 8 and Auto-Tune Live are designed to deliver high-quality and reliable pitch correction performance. They both use Antares' patented Evo Voice Processing Technology, which ensures accurate and natural-sounding pitch detection and manipulation. They also have low CPU usage and memory footprint, making them efficient and stable for any system.
