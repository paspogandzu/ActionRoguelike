Yakyuken (éçæ³, lit. "baseball fist") is a traditional Japanese game that dates back to the Edo period. It is played by three players: a host and two contestants. The host cries out "Play ball" and the contestants dance to music played on the shamisen and taiko. The host chants "Runner ni nattara essassa." ("Hope the batter gets to run"). The contestants then show their hand gestures for rock, paper or scissors. The loser has to remove an article of clothing or drink sake. The game continues until one contestant is naked or drunk[^2^].
 
The Yakyuken Special PC is a rare and obscure game that appeals to fans of Japanese culture and eroticism. It is a simple but addictive game that tests the player's luck and skill in yakyuken. The game also features voice acting and animations for the opponents, who have different personalities and reactions. The game is not available on any official online platforms, but can be found on some websites that offer retro games for download.

Societa Daikanyama is a Japanese video game developer that was founded in 1992. The company is known for creating adult-oriented games, such as The Yakyuken Special PC, The Yakyuken Special 2, and The Yakyuken Special 3.

Yakyuken is a simple game that anyone can play. The rules are similar to rock-paper-scissors, but with some variations. The game can be played with two or more players, but usually three. One player acts as the host and the other two are the contestants. The host starts the game by saying "Play ball" and then counts to three. On the count of three, the contestants show their hand gestures for rock, paper or scissors. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. The loser of the round has to remove an article of clothing or drink sake. If there is a tie, the round is repeated. The game continues until one contestant is naked or drunk, or until the host decides to end the game.
 
The Yakyuken Special PC is a game that captures the essence of yakyuken in a digital format. The game features 12 different opponents, each with their own name, voice, and personality.

In story mode, the player has to face all 12 opponents in a fixed order. In free mode, the player can choose any opponent and difficulty level. The game also has a gallery mode, where the player can view the images and animations of the opponents they have defeated.
