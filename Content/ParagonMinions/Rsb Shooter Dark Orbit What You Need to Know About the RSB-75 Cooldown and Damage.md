## How to Get Rsb-75 Ammo
 
Rsb-75 ammo is not easy to get in Dark Orbit. It is not sold in the shop, and it is only available during special events or through assembly. To get Rsb-75 ammo from the shop, you need to wait for an event that offers it as a reward or a discount. For example, during the Galaxy Gate event, you can get Rsb-75 ammo for 5 uridium per shot. To get Rsb-75 ammo from assembly, you need to collect the following materials:

- 4,000 Uridium
- 2,500 Rinusk
- 400 Trace

With these materials, you can assemble 15,000 Rsb-75 shots. However, this is a very expensive and time-consuming process, so you should only do it if you really need it.
 
## How to Use Rsb-75 Ammo Effectively
 
Rsb-75 ammo is a powerful weapon in Dark Orbit, but it also has some limitations. To use it effectively, you need to follow some tips and strategies. Here are some of them:

- Use Rsb-75 ammo only when you have a clear shot at your target. Don't waste it on enemies that are too far away, too close, or behind obstacles.
- Use Rsb-75 ammo only when you have enough shield and hit points. Don't risk getting killed by exposing yourself too much.
- Use Rsb-75 ammo only when you have enough backup and support. Don't go solo against multiple enemies or stronger opponents.
- Use Rsb-75 ammo only when you have enough ammo and uridium. Don't run out of resources in the middle of a fight.
- Use Rsb-75 ammo only when you have a good reason. Don't use it for fun or for show.

By following these tips, you can make the most out of your Rsb-75 ammo and dominate the space battles in Dark Orbit.
