Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes is a 1984 adventure drama film directed by Hugh Hudson and based on the novel Tarzan of the Apes by Edgar Rice Burroughs. It stars Christopher Lambert as Tarzan, Andie MacDowell as Jane Porter, and Ralph Richardson as the Earl of Greystoke.
 
The film tells the story of John Clayton, the son of a Scottish nobleman who was shipwrecked in Africa and raised by a tribe of apes. He grows up as Tarzan, the king of the jungle, until he is discovered by an expedition led by Captain Phillippe D'Arnot (Ian Holm). D'Arnot teaches Tarzan to speak English and takes him to England, where he is introduced to his grandfather, the Earl of Greystoke, and his cousin, Jane Porter. Tarzan struggles to adapt to the civilized world and his true identity, while also facing a threat from his uncle, who wants to inherit the Greystoke estate.

One of the most remarkable aspects of the film is the performance of Christopher Lambert as Tarzan. Lambert, who was born in New York but raised in Switzerland and France, had to learn English for the role. He also underwent physical training and learned to mimic the sounds and movements of apes. He convincingly portrays Tarzan's innocence, curiosity, and strength, as well as his emotional conflict between his two worlds.
 
Another highlight of the film is the use of real apes to portray Tarzan's family. The filmmakers hired Rick Baker, a renowned makeup artist and special effects expert, to create realistic ape costumes and masks. Baker also trained four chimpanzees, one gorilla, and one orangutan to act alongside Lambert. The result is a stunning and believable depiction of Tarzan's bond with the apes, especially with his adoptive mother, Kala.
 
The film also features a beautiful and haunting score by John Scott, who incorporated African drums and chants into his orchestral compositions. The music enhances the mood and atmosphere of the film, as well as the emotions of the characters. The main theme, "Greystoke", is a memorable and stirring piece that captures the essence of Tarzan's journey.

The film is not without its flaws, however. Some critics and viewers have criticized the film for its portrayal of African natives, who are shown as either savage or subservient. The film also ignores the colonial and racial implications of Tarzan's story, and focuses more on his personal identity. Furthermore, some fans of the original novel were disappointed by the changes made to the plot and characters, such as the omission of Tarzan's son and the alteration of Jane's personality.
 
Another issue that the film faced was the dubbing of Andie MacDowell's voice. MacDowell, who was a model and a newcomer to acting, spoke with a thick Southern accent that did not fit her character. The filmmakers decided to replace her voice with that of Glenn Close, who had a more refined and British accent. MacDowell was reportedly unhappy with this decision, and felt that it undermined her performance.
 
Despite these drawbacks, Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes remains a powerful and captivating film that explores the themes of identity, nature, and civilization. It is a tribute to the enduring legacy of Edgar Rice Burroughs' creation, and a testament to the talent and vision of Hugh Hudson and his cast and crew.
